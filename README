JScheduler/Executer (JSE) provides scheduling and multi-threaded execution of
jobs in Java.  At its base, JSE is a set of classes that can be used by any
Java application that needs to queue and run batch jobs, schedule a job to be
run at a future point in time, or schedule a recurring job.

JSE also contains a standalone daemon that provides Unix Cron style job
scheduling for Java.  Since the JSE cron server is a long running process, jobs
written in Java can easily be run on any schedule without the overhead of
launching a new JVM for each run, or worse, launching several long running JVMs
with each performing its own function.  JSE/Cron is useful for system
monitoring jobs that must be run on short intervals and daily chores such as
running reports or queue processing.
